From this stacked bar chart we can see that Diaz' output (goals and assists) improved greatly in the 24/25 season compared the the previous season. This is despite the underlying metrics 
being almost identical. The key stats that we can see have improved in the 24/25 seeason (in addition to goals) are his shots on target ratio, and his xG per shot. This indicates that while 
he is taking a similair number of shots - and producing a similair xG - he is prioritising high value xG shots and thus is hitting the target with more shots and hence scoring more 
frequently. This aligns with the new managers tactical approach of taking slightly less risks. We can see that Diaz' shot map from the two seasons shifts more centrally towards the higher xG 
chances, of which almost all his goals across the two seasons come from anyway. The change towards higher efficiency shots also corresponds with a slight position change with Diaz playing up 
front 14 times in 24/25 compared to 0 times the prior season, moving Diaz to naturally be in the higher percentage quadrants closer to the middle of the goal and the 6 yard box. So clearly we
can see that xG is not created equally for all players, especially not for players like diaz who are not naturally supremely talented finishers (relative to his level in Europe's elite) and 
singular higher xG chances can often be more valuable than numerous lower quality chances all adding up even if the maths tells us that the probability of scoring is the same.
